Elasticsearch JDBC river
========================
[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/923fd9217a917db5b3c415e8b696b5c7/m "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/923fd9217a917db5b3c415e8b696b5c7)

The Java Database Connection (JDBC) `river <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/river/>`_  allows to fetch data from JDBC sources for indexing into `Elasticsearch <http://www.elasticsearch.org>`_. 

It is implemented as an `Elasticsearch plugin <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/modules/plugins.html>`_.

The relational data is internally transformed into structured JSON objects for the schema-less indexing model in Elasticsearch. 

This fork of the elasticsearch JDBC river is supporting the following river types:
- Oneshot
- Simple
- Table
-

Creating a JDBC river is easy::

    curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river/_meta' -d '{
        "type" : "jdbc",
        "jdbc" : {
            "driver" : "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver",
            "url" : "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test",
            "user" : "",
            "password" : "",
            "sql" : "select * from orders"
        }
    }'
